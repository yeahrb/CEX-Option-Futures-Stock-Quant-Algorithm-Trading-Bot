# Yeah

Practical Ruby video game framework, alpha stage

Project has been stalled after gaining a better understanding of the problem space and programming. I started this to help me build awesome games quickly and easily. However, I found that Yeah's fundamental design is too abstracted from the hardware to perform well as a base for video games. 

A gem with a drawing API similar to Yeah's is [ruby-processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing).

## Features

* Designed to be easy to learn and fast to build games with
* Embraces Ruby's strengths (object-orientation, duck typing, focus on developer happiness)
* Platform-agnostic (currently compiles to web pages through [Opal](http://opalrb.org); PC executables and mobile apps planned)
* Convention (over configuration)-oriented
* Processing/HTML5 Canvas-style drawing API
* Command-line utilities (no monolithic IDE)
* Open source under MIT license
